st.write("""
         We solve the three-body proble of the popular Chinese sci-fi novel "The Three-Body Problem" by Liu Cixin.
         The novel is about the first contact between humanity and an alien civilization from the Trisolaris system.
         The story is set against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution in China and explores themes of science, philosophy, and the nature of humanity.

         We use reinforcement learning (RL) to predict the trajectory of the three-body problem.
         The three-body problem is a classic problem in physics and astronomy that involves predicting the motion of three celestial bodies under their mutual gravitational attraction.
         The problem is notoriously difficult to solve, and there is no general solution for it.
         We use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to train an agent to predict the optimal choice of action the emperor should take in the game.
